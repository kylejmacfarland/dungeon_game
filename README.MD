# Dungeon Game 0.1.0

An experiment with synthesizing LLM text generation with traditional procedural generation techniques.


## What is this?

This is a (currently text-based) RPG game that utilizes LLM text generation to for certain descriptions and character interactions. You can think of it as a computer RPG with an AI Dungeon Master.


## Why?

I believe that recent AI technologies allow for a whole new world of design space for procedurally generated video games, and that the tech is not currently being utilized to its full potential.

It's also a fun project to work on and a nice portfolio piece.


## How to Use

### Startup

This program requires you to connect to an LLM server. Specify the server you wish to connect to with the command line arguement ```-url=<http://someurl.com:1234>```. If the program fails to connect to that URL or if no URL is specified, the program will attempt to connect to a local ollama server.

### Gameplay

Select commands by entering the corresponding integer.
Enter 0 to exit the program.

## Warning
